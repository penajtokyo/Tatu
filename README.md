# Tatu App by Ink Inc.

## Overview
An app that allows users to search for tattoos and tattoo artists based on certain criteria and tags (style and placement on the body) and returns images and details of the tattoo that meet the userâ€™s criteria.

## Why is this app needed?
The need for this app is based on personal experience in trying to find an artist that does a particular type of tattoo, and there is no consistence resource (and most tattoo parlors websites lack detail and functionality).

## Regular User Flow and Functionality
- As a customer looking for specific types of tattoos or even just looking to see what kinds of tattoos are out there, our app allows new users to create an account login information* (using the Create Account Button and corresponding form on the Home Page) and then search our database of artist's that have accounts on Tatu (and have uploaded images). We have an extensive list of both styles and body placement options that users can use to narrow down their search.
- When their page first loads they are presented with all Tattoo Images and Cards that are in our Database, which allows them to fully browse all styles and placement before choosing to narrow it down using the search feature.
- Once they are done, they can hit the logout button in the Nav bar and are directed back the Home page.
- *Note: User's passwords are encrypted before being stored in our database, for our user's security.

## Tattoo Artist Flow and Functionality
- As a tattoo artist, I want to be able to have a location dedicated to me and my art work, and be a conduit for users to connect with artists. Tatu allows tattoo artists to create an account and login information* (using the Create Account Button and corresponding form on the Home Page), upload images and details of their work to their account, that will then be shared with our broader user base.
- Tattoo artists can use the add photo modal/form (button found in the lower right corner) to add images to our database that will the display in their gallery and to our user's search results and default galleries.
- Artists can also edit their information in the Edit Profile modal/form (button found in the lower right corner) if any of their information changes. This will update our datbase, and in turn updates the details found on the images they have in their and the user's galleries.
- Once they are done, they can hit the logout button in the Nav bar and are directed back the Home page.
- *Note: User's passwords are encrypted before being stored in our database, for our user's security.

## Future Enhancements

- User Page:
     * Improve default gallery view to include categories of each style, that if the header is clicked then displays the cards with more details for each image found in that category.
     * Allows users to save cards to their profile of tattoos they like/are interested in.
     * Add a link in each card to go direclty to that tattoo artist profile page to view all of their images and/or contact information.
     * Add a chat feature to connect users to the tattoo artist

- Artist page:
    * Create a separate display only version that users can go to to see that artist's gallery of images and contact information
    * Add the search feature to the artist's landing page so they can also utilize our database of images to see other artist's information.
    * Add a calendar and appointment making functionality.
